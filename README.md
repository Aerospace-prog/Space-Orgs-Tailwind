# Practising and Learning Tailwind CSS P1;

**Why Tailwind CSS**
Tailwind CSS is a utility-first framework that enables rapid and scalable UI development by using predefined classes directly in HTML/JSX. It eliminates the need for writing custom CSS, optimizes for production by removing unused styles, and offers built-in responsiveness, dark mode, and easy customization. Ideal for modern frameworks like React, it boosts productivity by reducing context switching. ðŸš€
